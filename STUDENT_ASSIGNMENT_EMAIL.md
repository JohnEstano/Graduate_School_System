            ->send(new \App\Mail\StudentAssignedToAdviser($adviserUser, $student, $coordinator));
        
        Log::info('Student Assignment: Email sent to adviser', [
            'adviser_id' => $adviserUser->id,
            'adviser_email' => $adviserUser->email,
            'student_id' => $student->id,
            'student_name' => trim(($student->first_name ?? '') . ' ' . ($student->last_name ?? '')),
            'coordinator_id' => $coordinator->id
        ]);
    }
} catch (\Exception $e) {
    Log::error('Student Assignment: Failed to send email to adviser', [
        'adviser_id' => $adviserUser->id,
        'adviser_email' => $adviserUser->email ?? 'N/A',
        'student_id' => $student->id,
