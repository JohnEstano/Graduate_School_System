# Mark as Completed - Full Status Update

## Overview
The "Mark as Completed" button in the AA defense details page now correctly updates BOTH:
1. **Defense Request Status** â†’ `Completed`
2. **AA Verification Status** â†’ `completed`

## Implementation

### Backend (DefenseRequestController.php)
**Route:** `POST /defense-requests/{defenseRequest}/complete`

**Method:** `completeDefense(DefenseRequest $defenseRequest)`

**What it does:**
```php
1. Updates defense_requests table:
   - status = 'Completed'
   - workflow_state = 'completed'

2. Creates/updates aa_payment_verifications table:
   - Gets or creates verification record
   - Sets status = 'completed'
   - Sets assigned_to = current user

3. Returns JSON response:
   {
     "success": true,
     "message": "Defense marked as completed",
     "aa_verification_id": 3,
     "aa_verification_status": "completed"
   }
```

### Frontend (assistant/all-defense-list/details.tsx)

**Button:** "Mark as Completed" (with CircleCheck icon)

**Handler:** `handleMarkCompleted()`

**Flow:**
```typescript
1. Refreshes CSRF token
2. Sends POST to /defense-requests/{id}/complete
3. On success, updates local state:
   - status: 'Completed'
   - workflow_state: 'completed'
   - aa_verification_status: 'completed'
   - aa_verification_id: (from response)
4. Shows success toast
```

## User Experience

**Before clicking:**
- Defense request may be in any state
- AA verification status may be: pending, ready_for_finance, in_progress, or paid

**After clicking:**
- Defense request status: **Completed**
- AA verification status: **completed**
- Button becomes disabled (because request is completed)
- Toast message: "Defense marked as completed"

## Database Changes
