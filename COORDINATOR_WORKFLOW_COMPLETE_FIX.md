# Coordinator Workflow Complete Fix

## Summary
This document outlines the comprehensive fixes made to the coordinator workflow for defense requirements, including panel assignment rendering based on program level, coordinator signature workflow, and proper separation of adviser and coordinator document generation.

---

## 1. Panel Assignment Based on Program Level

### Problem
The system was showing all 5 panel member fields (Chairperson + 4 Panelists) regardless of the program level. According to academic standards:
- **Masteral programs**: Require 3 panel members (Chairperson + 2 Panelists)
- **Doctorate programs**: Require 4 panel members (Chairperson + 3 Panelists)

### Solution
**Files Modified:**
- `resources/js/pages/coordinator/submissions/defense-request/details.tsx`

**Changes:**
1. **Panel Assignment Section**: Updated to conditionally render panel member comboboxes based on `request.program_level`
   - Always shows: Chairperson, Panelist 1, Panelist 2
   - Conditionally shows (Doctorate only): Panelist 3, Panelist 4
   - Added helper text showing the requirement based on program level

2. **Committee Table**: Updated to only show relevant panel members in the committee table
   - Built dynamic rows array that includes base rows (Adviser, Chairperson, Panelist 1, Panelist 2)
   - Conditionally adds Panelist 3 and 4 rows only for Doctorate programs
   - Maintains payment rate calculations for all shown members

**Code Example:**
```tsx
{/* Show program level info */}
<div className="text-xs text-muted-foreground mb-2">
  {request.program_level === 'Doctorate' 
    ? 'Doctorate program: 4 panel members required (Chairperson + 3 Panelists)'
    : 'Masteral program: 3 panel members required (Chairperson + 2 Panelists)'}
</div>

{/* Conditionally render Panelist 3 and 4 */}
{request.program_level === 'Doctorate' && [
  { label: 'Panelist 3', key: 'defense_panelist3' },
  { label: 'Panelist 4', key: 'defense_panelist4' }
].map(({ label, key }) => (
  <PanelMemberCombobox
    key={key}
    label={label}
    value={panels[key as keyof typeof panels]}
    onChange={v => setPanels(p => ({ ...p, [key]: v }))}
    options={panelOptionsForAssignment}
    disabled={!canEdit || loadingMembers}
    taken={taken}
  />
))}
```

## 2. Coordinator Approve Dialog with Signature Workflow

### Problem
The coordinator approval process was using a simple confirmation dialog without proper document signing workflow. The coordinator needs to:
1. Review the endorsement form
2. Manage their signature
3. Sign the document with their credentials
4. Have a separate workflow from the adviser's endorsement

### Solution
**Files Created:**
- `resources/js/pages/coordinator/submissions/defense-request/coordinator-approve-dialog.tsx`

**Features Implemented:**

### A. Three-Tab Interface
1. **Preview Tab**: Shows the generated endorsement form in an iframe
   - Auto-generates document when dialog opens
   - Displays PDF preview
   - Allows regeneration if needed

2. **Signature Tab**: Signature management system
   - Lists all coordinator's saved signatures
   - Shows active signature with visual indicator
   - Allows drawing new signatures using canvas
   - Activate/deactivate signatures
   - Visual feedback for active signature

3. **Upload Tab**: Alternative upload option
   - Drag-and-drop PDF upload
   - File browser option
   - Preview uploaded file before use

### B. Approval Workflow
```typescript
async function handleFinalApprove() {
  // STEP 1: Save endorsement form to database
  // - If uploaded file: save via FormData
  // - If generated: convert blob to file and upload
  
  // STEP 2: Update coordinator status to "Approved"
  // - Calls new endpoint: /coordinator/defense-requirements/{id}/coordinator-status
  // - Updates workflow state
  // - Logs workflow history
  
  // STEP 3: Trigger completion callback
  // - Refreshes page to show updated status
}
```

### C. Integration
**File Modified:**
- `resources/js/pages/coordinator/submissions/defense-request/details.tsx`

**Changes:**
1. Import the new dialog component
2. Add state for dialog open/close
3. Replace the simple "Approve" button with "Approve & Sign" that opens the dialog
4. Add the dialog component before the confirmation dialog

```tsx
{/* Approve button: opens the coordinator approve dialog */}
<Button
  size="sm"
  variant="outline"
  onClick={() => setApproveDialogOpen(true)}
  disabled={
    isLoading ||
    request.coordinator_status === 'Approved' ||
    request.workflow_state === 'completed'
  }
>
  <CheckCircle className="h-4 w-4 mr-1 text-green-600" />
  Approve & Sign
</Button>
```

## 3. Role-Based Document Field Filtering

### Problem
When advisers generated endorsement forms, the system was filling ALL fields including coordinator and dean signatures/names. Similarly, coordinators would potentially overwrite adviser fields. This causes:
- Premature filling of fields that shouldn't be filled yet
- Confusion about who signed what
- Potential data integrity issues

### Solution

### A. Frontend Changes
**Files Modified:**
- `resources/js/pages/adviser/defense-requirements/endorsement-dialog.tsx`
- `resources/js/pages/coordinator/submissions/defense-request/coordinator-approve-dialog.tsx`

**Changes:**
Both dialogs now pass a `role` parameter when generating documents:

```typescript
// Adviser Dialog
body: JSON.stringify({
  template_id: selectedTemplate.id,
  defense_request_id: defenseRequest.id,
  fields: {},
  role: 'adviser' // Specify role to prevent filling coordinator fields
})

// Coordinator Dialog
body: JSON.stringify({
  template_id: selectedTemplate.id,
  defense_request_id: defenseRequest.id,
  fields: {},
  role: 'coordinator' // Specify role to fill coordinator fields only
})
```

### B. Backend Changes

#### GeneratedDocumentController.php
**File Modified:**
- `app/Http/Controllers/GeneratedDocumentController.php`

**Changes:**
1. Added `role` validation to `generateDocument` method
2. Pass role to DocumentGenerator service

```php
$request->validate([
    'template_id' => 'required|integer|exists:document_templates,id',
    'defense_request_id' => 'required|integer|exists:defense_requests,id',
    'fields' => 'array',
    'role' => 'nullable|in:adviser,coordinator', // Add role parameter
]);

// Pass role to generator for field filtering
$generated = $generator->generate(
    $tpl, 
    $defenseRequest, 
    $request->fields ?? [],
    $request->role ?? null
);
```

#### DocumentGenerator.php
**File Modified:**
- `app/Services/DocumentGenerator.php`

**Changes:**
1. Updated `generate` method signature to accept role parameter
2. Added role-based field filtering logic in the field rendering loop

```php
public function generate(
    DocumentTemplate $tpl, 
    DefenseRequest $req, 
    array $overrides = [], 
    ?string $role = null
): GeneratedDocument {
    // ... existing code ...
    
    foreach ($fields as $f) {
        if ($f['page'] != $p) continue;

        // Role-based field filtering
        if ($role) {
            $fieldKey = $f['key'] ?? '';
            
            // If adviser is generating, skip coordinator and dean signatures
            if ($role === 'adviser' && (
                str_contains($fieldKey, 'coordinator') || 
                str_contains($fieldKey, 'dean')
            )) {
                continue; // Skip this field
            }
            
            // If coordinator is generating, skip adviser signature (already filled)
            if ($role === 'coordinator' && str_contains($fieldKey, 'signature.adviser')) {
                continue; // Skip this field
            }
        }
        
        // ... render field ...
    }
}
```

**Field Filtering Logic:**
- **Adviser role**: Skips fields containing "coordinator" or "dean"
  - Fills: student info, thesis details, schedule, adviser signature/name, committee names
  - Skips: coordinator signature/name, dean signature/name

- **Coordinator role**: Skips adviser signature (already filled by adviser)
  - Fills: coordinator signature/name, dean fields (if applicable), any missing schedule/committee info
  - Skips: adviser signature (preserves what adviser filled)

## 4. Backend API for Coordinator Status Update

### Problem
There was no dedicated endpoint for coordinators to update their approval status separate from the general status update endpoint.

### Solution

### A. Route Added
**File Modified:**
- `routes/web.php`

```php
/* Update Coordinator Status for Defense Requirements */
Route::patch('/coordinator/defense-requirements/{defenseRequest}/coordinator-status', 
    [\App\Http\Controllers\DefenseRequestController::class, 'updateCoordinatorStatus'])
    ->middleware(['auth'])
    ->name('coordinator.defense-requirements.coordinator-status');
```

### B. Controller Method Added
**File Modified:**
- `app/Http/Controllers/DefenseRequestController.php`

**Method:** `updateCoordinatorStatus`

**Features:**
1. Authorization check (Coordinator, Administrative Assistant, or Dean roles only)
2. Validates coordinator_status (Approved, Rejected, Pending)
3. Updates workflow_state based on coordinator_status:
   - Approved → `coordinator-approved`
   - Rejected → `coordinator-rejected`
   - Pending → `coordinator-review`
4. Logs workflow history with event details
5. Database transaction for atomicity
6. Returns updated request data

```php
public function updateCoordinatorStatus(Request $request, DefenseRequest $defenseRequest)
{
    // Authorization
    if (!in_array($user->role, ['Coordinator', 'Administrative Assistant', 'Dean'])) {
        return response()->json(['error' => 'Unauthorized'], 403);
    }

    // Validate
    $data = $request->validate([
        'coordinator_status' => 'required|in:Approved,Rejected,Pending',
        'coordinator_user_id' => 'nullable|integer|exists:users,id'
    ]);

    DB::beginTransaction();
    try {
        // Update status and workflow state
        $defenseRequest->coordinator_status = $data['coordinator_status'];
        $defenseRequest->workflow_state = /* based on status */;
        $defenseRequest->save();

        // Log workflow history
        $history[] = [
            'event_type' => 'coordinator-status-update',
            'from_state' => $previousStatus,
            'to_state' => $data['coordinator_status'],
            // ... other fields
        ];

        DB::commit();
        return response()->json(['ok' => true, 'request' => $defenseRequest->fresh()]);
    } catch (\Throwable $e) {
        DB::rollBack();
        return response()->json(['error' => 'Failed to update'], 500);
    }
}
```

---

## 5. Program Level Helper

### Existing Helper
**File:** `app/Helpers/ProgramLevel.php`

**Purpose:** Maps program names to program levels (Masteral, Doctorate, Bachelors)

**Note:** Currently maps ALL Bachelor programs to "Masteral" for testing purposes since payment rates only exist for Masteral/Doctorate. This should be updated in production.

```php
public static function getLevel(?string $program): string
{
    if (!$program) return 'Masteral';

    // Check for Doctorate keywords first
    $doctorateKeywords = ['doctor', 'doctorate', 'doctoral', 'phd', /* ... */];
    foreach ($doctorateKeywords as $kw) {
        if (str_contains($p, $kw)) {
            return 'Doctorate';
        }
    }

    // FOR TESTING: Map ALL other programs (including Bachelors) to Masteral
    return 'Masteral';
}
```

## Next Steps / Recommendations

1. **Testing**: Thoroughly test all workflows with different program levels and user roles

2. **Email Notifications**: Consider adding email notifications when coordinator approves/rejects

3. **Program Level Mapping**: Update `ProgramLevel.php` to properly handle Bachelor programs once payment rates are added

4. **Audit Trail**: Consider adding more detailed audit logging for signature usage

5. **Document Archive**: Implement document versioning to track changes to endorsement forms

6. **Dean Approval**: If dean approval is required, create similar dean-approve-dialog.tsx

7. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Test the coordinator approve dialog on mobile devices

8. **Accessibility**: Add ARIA labels and keyboard navigation for the signature canvas

9. **Performance**: Consider caching generated PDFs if they're accessed frequently

10. **Security**: Add additional validation to prevent unauthorized signature usage

---

## Known Issues / Limitations

1. **Bachelor Programs**: Currently mapped to "Masteral" for testing - needs proper payment rates

2. **Signature Image Format**: Limited to PNG/JPEG/GIF - consider adding SVG support

3. **PDF Generation Performance**: Large PDFs may take time to generate - consider background processing

4. **Concurrent Edits**: No optimistic locking - multiple coordinators could overwrite changes

5. **File Size Limits**: PDF upload limited by server configuration - document this clearly

---

## Conclusion

The coordinator workflow has been comprehensively fixed with:
- ✅ Dynamic panel assignment based on program level
- ✅ Dedicated coordinator approval dialog with signature workflow
- ✅ Role-based document field filtering (adviser vs coordinator)
- ✅ Proper separation of concerns between adviser and coordinator endorsement
- ✅ Backend API for coordinator status updates
- ✅ Workflow history logging
- ✅ Visual feedback and user-friendly UI

The system now provides a robust, professional workflow for both advisers and coordinators to properly endorse and approve defense requests with their respective signatures and credentials.
