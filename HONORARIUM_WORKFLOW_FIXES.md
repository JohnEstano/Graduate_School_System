# Honorarium & Student Records Workflow Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… Records Created at Wrong Time
**Problem:** Records were being created when AA clicked "Mark as Completed" instead of when clicking "Ready for Finance"

**Solution:** Moved `HonorariumPayment` creation from `DefenseRequestController@completeDefense()` to `AaPaymentVerificationObserver@updated()` method. Now:
- When AA clicks "Ready for Finance" â†’ status changes to `ready_for_finance`
- Observer detects the status change
- Observer creates Honorarium Payments
- Observer triggers sync to student/panelist records

**Files Modified:**
- `app/Observers/AaPaymentVerificationObserver.php` - Added `createHonorariumPayments()` method
- `app/Http/Controllers/DefenseRequestController.php` - Removed payment creation logic from `completeDefense()`

---

### 2. âœ… Adviser Showing in /honorarium Page
**Problem:** Advisers were appearing in the honorarium page alongside Panel Chair and Panel Members

**Solution:** Added filter in `HonorariumSummaryController@show()` to exclude panelists with "Adviser" role. Now only Panel Chair and Panel Members are displayed.

**Files Modified:**
- `app/Http/Controllers/HonorariumSummaryController.php` - Added `.filter()` before `.map()` to exclude advisers

---

### 3. âœ… Payment Date Not Being Saved
**Problem:** `payment_date` field was NULL in defense_requests table even though form had the field

**Solution:** 
- Added `paymentDate` and `amount` to validation rules in `DefenseRequestController@store()`
- Updated form submission to transform data from snake_case to camelCase
- Added payment_date and amount to `DefenseRequest::create()` array

**Files Modified:**
- `app/Http/Controllers/DefenseRequestController.php` - Added validation and save logic
- `resources/js/pages/student/submissions/defense-requirements/submit-defense-requirements.tsx` - Fixed form data transformation

---

### 4. âœ… Duplicate Payment Records
**Problem:** Payment records were being created 3 times (showing 9 payments instead of 3)

**Solution:** Changed `PaymentRecord::create()` to `PaymentRecord::updateOrCreate()` in sync service to prevent duplicates when sync runs multiple times.

**Files Modified:**
- `app/Services/StudentRecordSyncService.php` - Changed to `updateOrCreate()` with unique constraints

---

## How The Workflow Now Works

### Step 1: Student Submits Defense Request
1. Student fills out form including:
   - Defense Type (Proposal, Pre-final, Final)
   - Payment Date âœ…
   - Amount (auto-calculated) âœ…
   - Files, etc.
2. Form data is saved to `defense_requests` table
3. Workflow state = `submitted`

### Step 2: Approvals
1. Adviser approves â†’ workflow_state = `adviser-approved`
2. Dean approves â†’ workflow_state = `coordinator-approved`
3. Registrar assigns panels and schedules â†’ workflow_state = `scheduled`

### Step 3: AA Marks "Ready for Finance" âœ…
1. AA opens defense request details
2. AA clicks "Ready for Finance" button
3. System updates `aa_payment_verifications` status = `ready_for_finance`
4. **AaPaymentVerificationObserver triggers:**
   - Creates `HonorariumPayment` records for:
     - Adviser âœ…
     - Panel Chair âœ…
     - Panel Member 1 âœ…
     - Panel Member 2 (if assigned)
     - Panel Member 3 (if assigned)
     - Panel Member 4 (if assigned)
   - Each payment includes:
     - `amount` (from PaymentRate table)
     - `payment_date` (from defense_request.payment_date) âœ…
     - `role`, `panelist_name`, etc.

### Step 4: Sync to Student/Panelist Records âœ…
After creating HonorariumPayments, observer calls `StudentRecordSyncService`:
1. Creates/updates `ProgramRecord`
2. Creates/updates `StudentRecord` with `program_record_id` link
3. For each HonorariumPayment:
   - Creates/updates `PanelistRecord` with proper name parsing
   - Creates/updates `PaymentRecord` (using updateOrCreate to avoid duplicates) âœ…
   - Links panelist to student via `panelist_student_records` pivot table with role

### Step 5: View Records
**`/honorarium` page:**
- Shows Program Records
- Shows only Panel Chair and Panel Members (Advisers excluded) âœ…
- Shows payment breakdowns

**`/student-records` page:**
- Shows Student Records
- Shows payment records (no duplicates) âœ…
- Shows payment_date correctly âœ…

### Step 6: AA Marks "Completed" (Optional)
When AA clicks "Mark as Completed":
- workflow_state = `completed`
- aa_verification status = `completed`
- No payments created (already created at ready_for_finance stage)

## Testing Checklist

### âœ… Test 1: Payment Date Saved
1. Student submits new defense request with payment_date
2. Check `defense_requests` table â†’ payment_date should have value

### âœ… Test 2: Records Created at Ready for Finance
1. AA clicks "Ready for Finance" (NOT "Mark as Completed")
2. Check `honorarium_payments` table â†’ should have records
3. Check `student_records` table â†’ should have record
4. Check `panelist_records` table â†’ should have records
5. Check `payment_records` table â†’ should have records
6. Check `panelist_student_records` pivot table â†’ should have links with roles

### âœ… Test 3: Advisers Not in /honorarium
1. Go to `/honorarium` page
2. Click on a program
3. Verify only Panel Chair and Panel Members shown (no Advisers)

### âœ… Test 4: No Duplicate Payments
1. After AA marks "Ready for Finance"
2. Go to `/student-records`
3. Click on student
4. Verify payment breakdown shows 3 payments (not 9) âœ…

- `panelist_id` (nullable)
- `panelist_name`
- `role` ('Adviser', 'Panel Chair', 'Panel Member 1', etc.)
- `amount`
- `payment_date` âœ… - From defense_request.payment_date
- `payment_status` ('pending')

### payment_records

- `student_record_id`
- `panelist_record_id`
- `defense_request_id`

## Important Notes

1. **Observer watches TWO statuses:**
   - `ready_for_finance` - Creates payments and syncs âœ…
   - Status changed from 'completed' to only watch 'ready_for_finance'

2. **updateOrCreate prevents duplicates:**
   ```php
   PaymentRecord::updateOrCreate(
       [
           'student_record_id' => $studentRecord->id,
           'panelist_record_id' => $panelistRecord->id,
           'defense_request_id' => $defenseRequest->id,
       ],
       [
           'amount' => $honorariumPayment->amount,
           'payment_date' => $honorariumPayment->payment_date,
           'role' => $honorariumPayment->role,
           // ... other fields ...
       ]
   );
   ```

3. **Filter excludes advisers:**
   ```php
   $panelists = $record->panelists->filter(function($panelist) {
       $roles = $panelist->students->pluck('pivot.role')->map(fn($r) => $this->normalizeRole($r));
       foreach ($roles as $role) {
           if ($role === 'Panel Chair' || $role === 'Panel Member') {
               return true;
           }
       }
       return false;
   });
   ```

4. **Form data transformation:**
   ```tsx
   const formData = {
       paymentDate: data.payment_date ? format(data.payment_date, "yyyy-MM-dd") : null,
       amount: data.amount,
       // ... other fields ...
   };
   ```
