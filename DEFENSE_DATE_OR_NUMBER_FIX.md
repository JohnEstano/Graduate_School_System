# ✅ DEFENSE DATE & OR NUMBER FIX - COMPLETE

**Date**: October 26, 2025  
**Issue**: Defense date and OR number not displaying in frontend  
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED**

---

## 🔍 Problem Identified

The `StudentRecord` table had NULL values for:
- `defense_date` 
- `or_number`

Even though the data existed in the `DefenseRequest` table as:
- `scheduled_date`
- `reference_no`

---

## ✅ Solution Applied

### Updated `StudentRecordSyncService.php`

Changed the sync logic to copy the correct fields from DefenseRequest:

```php
'defense_date' => $defenseRequest->scheduled_date,  // ✅ Was: defense_date (NULL)
'or_number' => $defenseRequest->reference_no,       // ✅ Was: not included
```

---

## 📊 Verification Results

### Backend Data (Database)
```
✅ Student: John Paul ESTAÑO
   Defense Date: 2025-10-27 00:00:00
   OR Number: 0970789789

✅ Student: Donald Duck
   Defense Date: 2025-10-26 00:00:00
   OR Number: 1123123
```

### API Response (Frontend receives)
```json
{
  "student": {
    "defense_date": "2025-10-26",  ✅
    "or_number": "1123123"          ✅
  },
  "payment": {
    "defense_date": "2025-10-26",  ✅
    "or_number": "1123123"          ✅
  }
}
```

### React Component Rendering
```tsx
// Both fields are properly accessed:
{payment.defense_date || student.defense_date || "-"}  ✅
{payment.or_number || student.or_number || "-"}        ✅
```

---

## 🎯 What Now Works

### `/honorarium` Page → Individual Panelist View
- ✅ Defense Date displays correctly
- ✅ OR Number displays correctly
- ✅ Both fields visible for each student payment

### `/student-records` Page → Individual Student View
- ✅ Defense Date displays correctly
- ✅ OR Number displays correctly
