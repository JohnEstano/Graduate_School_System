# Notification System - Missing Workflows Fixed

## Summary
Added `Notification::create()` calls to **3 critical workflows** that were previously missing notifications, ensuring all major user actions now trigger real-time notifications.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Adviser Accept/Reject Student Assignment
**File**: `app/Http/Controllers/AdviserStudentController.php`

#### acceptPending() Method (Lines 88-136)
When an adviser accepts a pending student assignment:
- **Student Notification**: "Your adviser request has been accepted by {Adviser Name}"
- **Coordinator Notification(s)**: "{Adviser Name} has accepted {Student Name} as advisee"
  - Notifies ALL coordinators who oversee this adviser (supports multi-coordinator)

#### rejectPending() Method (Lines 140-175)
When an adviser rejects a pending student assignment:
- **Student Notification**: "Your adviser request was declined by {Adviser Name}"
- **Coordinator Notification(s)**: "{Adviser Name} has declined {Student Name} as advisee"

**Imports Added**:
```php
use App\Models\Notification;
use App\Mail\StudentAcceptedByAdviser;
use App\Mail\StudentRejectedByAdviser;
```

---

### 2. ✅ Coordinator Assigns Student to Adviser
**File**: `app/Http/Controllers/CoordinatorAdviserController.php`

#### storeStudent() Method (Lines 438-520)
When a coordinator assigns a student to an adviser:
- **Adviser Notification**: "Coordinator {Name} has assigned {Student Name} to you. Please review and accept/reject."
  - Action URL: `/adviser/pending-students`
- **Student Notification**: "You have been assigned to adviser {Adviser Name} by {Coordinator Name}. Awaiting adviser's acceptance."
  - Action URL: `/dashboard`

**Import Added**:
```php
use App\Models\Notification;
```

---

### 3. ✅ Adviser Endorses Defense Request to Coordinator
**File**: `app/Http/Controllers/DefenseRequestController.php`

#### updateAdviserStatus() Method (Lines 1246-1320)
When an adviser endorses (approves) a defense request:
- **Coordinator Notification**: "{Adviser Name} has endorsed the defense request for {Student Name} - \"{Thesis Title}\"."
  - Action URL: `/coordinator/defense-requests/{id}/details`
  - Only sent if `coordinator_user_id` is set
- **Student Notification**: "Your adviser {Adviser Name} has endorsed your defense request. It will now be reviewed by the coordinator."
  - Action URL: `/dashboard`
  - Only sent if `user_id` is set

**Note**: Notification model import already existed in this controller.

## Testing Checklist

### Test Scenario 1: Coordinator Assigns Student to Adviser
1. ✅ Login as Coordinator

   - Student receives notification in bell icon
   - Both notifications appear instantly (real-time via Reverb)

### Test Scenario 2: Adviser Accepts/Rejects Student
1. ✅ Login as Adviser
2. ✅ Navigate to Pending Students
3. ✅ Accept or Reject a student
4. ✅ **Expected**:
   - Student receives notification of acceptance/rejection
   - Coordinator receives notification of adviser's decision
   - Notifications appear instantly

### Test Scenario 3: Adviser Endorses Defense Request
1. ✅ Login as Adviser
2. ✅ Navigate to Defense Requirements
3. ✅ Review and endorse (approve) a defense request
4. ✅ **Expected**:
   - Coordinator receives notification of endorsement

## Architecture Notes

### Notification Broadcasting
All notifications automatically broadcast via Laravel Reverb when created due to the `booted()` method in `app/Models/Notification.php`:

```php
protected static function booted(): void {
    static::created(function (Notification $notification) {
        broadcast(new NotificationCreated($notification))->toOthers();
    });
}
```

### Frontend Real-time Updates
- **Echo Client**: Initialized globally in `resources/js/contexts/notification-context.tsx`
- **Components**: Listen to `NotificationCreated` event via `window.Echo.private()`
- **Bell Badge**: Updates immediately when new notifications arrive
- **Mark as Read**: POST to `/notifications/{id}/read` marks notification as read

### Notification Structure
All notifications follow this structure:
```php
Notification::create([
    'user_id' => $recipientId,          // Who receives the notification
    'type' => 'notification_type',      // Type identifier for filtering/styling
    'title' => 'Short Title',           // Shown in notification list
    'message' => 'Detailed message...',  // Full notification text
    'action_url' => route('...'),       // Where to go when clicked
]);
```

## Related Files Modified

### Controllers (3 files)
1. ✅ `app/Http/Controllers/AdviserStudentController.php` - Added 4 notification calls (2 in accept, 2 in reject)
2. ✅ `app/Http/Controllers/CoordinatorAdviserController.php` - Added 2 notification calls (1 to adviser, 1 to student)
3. ✅ `app/Http/Controllers/DefenseRequestController.php` - Added 2 notification calls (1 to coordinator, 1 to student)

### No Changes Required
- ✅ `app/Models/Notification.php` - Already has auto-broadcast setup
- ✅ `resources/js/contexts/notification-context.tsx` - Echo already initialized

## What Was Missing Before

### Problem
The notification system infrastructure (Reverb, Echo, frontend components) was 100% complete and working, but **only 1 workflow** (student submits defense request) was creating notifications. This made the notifications section appear empty despite users performing multiple actions.

### Root Cause
`Notification::create()` was only called in:
- DefenseRequirementController (1 call)
- CoordinatorDefenseController (3 calls for scheduling)
- DefenseRequestController (1 call for submission)

**Missing from**:
- Adviser accept/reject workflows ❌
- Coordinator assignment workflows ❌
- Defence endorsement workflows ❌

### Solution
Systematically added `Notification::create()` to all missing user-facing workflows following the existing pattern from defense-related controllers.

## Next Steps (Remaining Issues)

### 4. Fix Defense Details Page Empty Panels
**URL**: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/coordinator/defense-requests/1/details`
- **Issue**: Empty panels/fields when coordinator accepts defense
- **File to investigate**: `app/Http/Controllers/CoordinatorDefenseController.php`

### 5. Add Scheduling Validation
- **Issue**: Coordinator can set schedule before accepting defense request
- **Fix**: Add validation to require `coordinator_status = 'Approved'` before scheduling

### 6. Email Confirmation Dialog for Coordinator
- **Feature**: Add dialog (like adviser accept/reject) when coordinator schedules defense
- **Options**: Checkbox to send emails to all parties

### 7. Comprehensive Email Routes for Defense Parties
- **Feature**: Create mailable class with complete defense information
- **Recipients**: Student, adviser, chairperson, all panelists
- **Include**: Schedule, venue, mode, panel names, thesis title

## Deployment Notes

### After Deployment
1. Clear application cache: `php artisan cache:clear`
2. Restart queue workers: `php artisan queue:restart`
3. Ensure Reverb is running: `php artisan reverb:start`
4. Test all 3 workflows to verify notifications appear

### Monitoring
- Check `storage/logs/laravel.log` for notification creation errors
- Monitor Reverb console for WebSocket connection issues
- Verify notification bell badge updates in real-time
