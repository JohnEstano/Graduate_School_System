# Endorsement Dialog Fixes - Oct 23, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Signatures Being Deleted on Upload/Draw**
**Problem**: UserSignatureController was deleting ALL previous signatures when a new one was uploaded or drawn.

**Fix**: Changed the `store()` method to set previous signatures as `inactive` instead of deleting them.

**Files Changed**:
- `app/Http/Controllers/UserSignatureController.php`
  - Line ~13: Changed from deleting signatures to setting `active = false`
  - Added `destroy()` method for manual deletion
- `routes/web.php`
  - Added DELETE route: `/api/signatures/{signature}`

**Benefits**:
- Users can now save multiple signatures
- Previous signatures are preserved
- Users can delete unwanted signatures manually via delete button

### 2. **Debug Logging Added**
**Problem**: No visibility into what data is being loaded/sent during the endorsement process.

**Fix**: Added comprehensive console logging throughout the dialog.

**Logging Points**:
1. **Template Loading**: Logs all loaded templates and their fields
2. **Signature Loading**: Logs all loaded signatures
3. **Field Population**: Logs the populated field values from defense request data
4. **Field Filtering**: Logs breakdown of text fields vs signature fields
5. **Document Generation**: Logs the full payload being sent to `/api/generate-document`
6. **Endorsement**: Logs the document URL and endorsement request

**How to Debug**:
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Open the endorsement dialog
4. Watch the logs:
   ```
   Loaded templates: [...]
   Loaded signatures: [...]
   Populating fields from template: {...}
   Defense request data: {...}
   === Template Field Breakdown ===
   All fields: [...]
   Text fields: [...]
   Signature fields: [...]
   Populated field values: {...}
   ```
5. Click "Endorse Request" button
6. Watch the generation logs:
   ```
   === Starting endorsement process ===
   Selected template: {...}
   Selected signature ID: 1
   Field values to send: {...}
   Generating document with payload: {...}
   Document generation response: {...}
   ```

### 3. **Signature UI Improvements**
**Problem**: No way to delete signatures, hard to manage multiple signatures.

**Fix**: Added delete button to each signature thumbnail.

**Features**:
- Red trash icon in top-right corner of each signature
- Click to delete (with confirmation)
- Visual feedback with hover effects
- Active signature marked with green "Active" label

## Known Issue: Template Field Types

**Issue**: The template in database has `signature.adviser` field with `type: "text"` instead of `type: "signature"`.

**Current Data** (from database):
```json
{
  "id": "9a74a4bf-7d17-43c9-aa46-b122c12e427d",
  "key": "signature.adviser",
  "type": "text",  // ❌ SHOULD BE "signature"
  "page": 1,
  "x": 77,
  "y": 442.25927734375,
  "width": 200,
  "height": 30
}
```

**Impact**: 
- This field shows up in "Document Fields" section instead of being processed as a signature
- The signature won't be rendered on the PDF at the correct position

**To Fix**:
1. Go to Settings → Document Templates
2. Click "Edit" on "Endorsement Form (Prefinal)"
3. Select the `signature.adviser` field
4. Change its type from "text" to "signature"
5. Save the template

**Alternative Fix** (via database):
```sql
UPDATE document_templates 
SET fields = JSON_SET(
  fields,
  '$[1].type', 'signature'
)
WHERE id = 1 AND JSON_EXTRACT(fields, '$[1].key') = 'signature.adviser';
```

## Testing Checklist

### Signatures
- [ ] Open endorsement dialog
- [ ] Check Console: "Loaded signatures: [...]" shows existing signatures
- [ ] Verify signatures appear in "Existing" tab
- [ ] Active signature has green "Active" label
- [ ] Click a signature to select it (border turns blue)
- [ ] Delete button (trash icon) appears on each signature
- [ ] Click delete button → confirmation prompt → signature removed
- [ ] Draw a new signature on canvas
- [ ] Click "Save Signature" → signature saved and appears in Existing tab
- [ ] Upload a PNG signature → signature saved and appears in Existing tab
- [ ] Multiple signatures persist (not deleted when adding new ones)

### Document Fields
- [ ] Template auto-selects based on defense type
- [ ] Check Console: "All fields: [...]" shows template fields
- [ ] Check Console: "Text fields: [...]" shows non-signature fields
- [ ] Check Console: "Signature fields: [...]" shows signature type fields
- [ ] Document Fields section shows all non-signature fields
- [ ] Each field has pre-populated value from defense request
- [ ] Can edit field values before endorsing
- [ ] Check Console: "Populated field values: {...}" shows all mappings

### Document Generation
- [ ] Click "Endorse Request" button
- [ ] Check Console: "=== Starting endorsement process ===" appears
- [ ] Check Console: "Field values to send: {...}" shows all field data
- [ ] Check Console: "Generating document with payload: {...}" shows full request
- [ ] Check Console: "Document generation response: {...}" shows download URL
- [ ] Success toast: "Defense request endorsed successfully!"
- [ ] Dialog closes after 1.5 seconds
- [ ] Page refreshes with updated status

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Template Field Type**: Change `signature.adviser` from type "text" to "signature"
2. **Test Complete Flow**: Follow testing checklist above
3. **Check Generated PDF**: Verify signature appears at correct position
4. **Verify Field Mappings**: Check that all fields are populated correctly in PDF
