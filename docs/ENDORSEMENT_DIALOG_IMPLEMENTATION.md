# Endorsement Dialog Implementation

## Overview
A comprehensive endorsement dialog has been implemented for advisers to endorse defense requests with proper template selection, PDF preview, and e-signature management.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Template Selection with Auto-Matching**
- Automatically matches document template to defense type (Proposal, Prefinal, Final)
- Allows manual selection of templates for testing/flexibility
- Templates are loaded from the database based on their configured names
- Display template name and defense type in the selector

### 2. **PDF Preview**
- Full PDF preview of the selected template document
- Uses PDF.js to render all pages
- Scrollable preview window showing the complete document
- No sidebar or extra controls - clean, simple preview

### 3. **E-Signature Management**
Three options for managing signatures:

#### a. **Use Existing Signature**
- Displays all previously saved signatures
- Visual selection with grid layout
- Highlights active signature
- Click to select any saved signature

#### b. **Draw New Signature**
- Canvas-based signature drawing
- Guide line for consistent placement
- Clear button to restart
- Real-time signature capture
- Saves as PNG with proper dimensions

#### c. **Upload New Signature**
- Drag-and-drop file upload
- Click to browse for PNG files
- 1MB file size limit
- Transparent PNG support

### 4. **Endorsement Workflow**
1. Select endorsement template (auto-selected based on defense type)
2. Preview the document template
3. Select or create e-signature
4. Click "Endorse Request" button
5. System automatically:
   - Sets selected signature as active
   - Generates the endorsement document with filled fields
   - Updates defense request status to "Approved"
   - Shows success notification
   - Refreshes the page to show updated status

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
1. **`resources/js/pages/adviser/defense-requirements/endorsement-dialog.tsx`**
   - Main endorsement dialog component
   - Contains all logic for template selection, preview, and signature management
   - Handles document generation and status update

### Modified Files
1. **`resources/js/pages/adviser/defense-requirements/details-requirements.tsx`**
   - Added import for EndorsementDialog component
   - Added state for endorsement dialog open/close
   - Changed "Endorse" button to open the new dialog instead of old confirmation
   - Added EndorsementDialog component with proper props
   - Added onEndorsed callback to refresh data after successful endorsement

2. **`app/Services/DocumentGenerator.php`**
   - Updated signature path resolution to use public disk
   - Ensures proper path handling for signature images

## Technical Details

### Dependencies
- React 18+
- PDF.js for PDF rendering
- react-signature-canvas for signature drawing
- Shadcn UI components (Dialog, Select, Tabs, Button, etc.)
- Sonner for toast notifications

### API Endpoints Used
- `GET /api/document-templates` - Fetch available templates
- `GET /api/signatures` - Fetch user's signatures
- `POST /api/signatures` - Upload or create new signature
- `PATCH /api/signatures/{id}/activate` - Set signature as active
- `POST /api/generate-document` - Generate endorsement document with signatures
- `PATCH /adviser/defense-requirements/{id}/adviser-status` - Update endorsement status

### Data Flow
```
User clicks "Endorse" 
  ↓
Dialog opens with template selection
  ↓
Template auto-selected based on defense_type
  ↓
PDF preview loads
  ↓
User selects/creates signature
  ↓
User clicks "Endorse Request"
  ↓
1. Signature is set as active
2. Document is generated with mapped fields + signature
3. Defense request status updated to "Approved"
4. Success notification shown
5. Page refreshes to show new status
```

## Template Field Mapping
The document templates support these field keys:
- `student.full_name`, `student.first_name`, `student.last_name`
- `student.program`, `student.school_id`
- `request.thesis_title`, `request.defense_type`, `request.id`
- `schedule.date`, `schedule.time`, `schedule.venue`, `schedule.mode`
- `committee.adviser`, `committee.chairperson`, `committee.panelist1-4`
- `signature.adviser`, `signature.coordinator`, `signature.dean`
- `today.date`, `today.full_date`

## User Interface Design

### Design Principles
- Clean, professional appearance
- Step-by-step workflow (numbered sections)
- Visual feedback for selections (checkmarks)
- Loading states for all async operations
- Clear error messages
- Confirmation before endorsement

### Layout
- Modal dialog (max-width: 6xl)
- Student information card at top
- Template selection with preview
- Signature management with tabs
- Footer with legal notice and action buttons

## Security Considerations
1. CSRF token protection on all API calls
2. File upload validation (PNG only, max 1MB)
3. User authentication required
4. Signature activation restricted to signature owner
5. Endorsement only possible if coordinator exists

## Future Enhancements
Potential improvements:
- Preview generated document before final endorsement
- Batch endorsement for multiple requests
- Signature template library
- Document version history
- Email notification after endorsement
- PDF annotation support
- Multiple signature placement on single document

## Testing Checklist

## Notes

- PDF preview scale: 1.5 (can be adjusted for better quality/performance)
