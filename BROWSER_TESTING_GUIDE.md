# Browser Testing Guide

## How to Verify the Fix in Your Browser

### 1. Start the Development Server

```bash
php artisan serve
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test Honorarium Page

**URL**: `http://localhost:8000/honorarium`

**What you should see:**
- ✅ List of 2 programs:
  - Master in Information Technology
  - Bachelor of Science in Computer Science

**Click on "Master in Information Technology":**
- ✅ Should show 4 panelists:
  - Dr Mumbo Jumbo (Panel Chair)
  - asdasdasd (Panel Member 1)
  - John EStano (Panel Member 2)
  - Dr. Maria Escallera (Panel Member 3)

**Click on any panelist (e.g., "Dr Mumbo Jumbo"):**
- ✅ Should show student "Donald Duck"
- ✅ Should show defense details (date, type, OR number)
- ✅ Should show role "Panel Chair"
- ✅ Should show payment amount ₱12,313.00

### 3. Test Student Records Page

**URL**: `http://localhost:8000/student-records`

**What you should see:**
- ✅ List of 2 programs (same as honorarium)

**Click on "Bachelor of Science in Computer Science":**
- ✅ Should show 1 student: John Paul ESTAÑO

**Click on the student name:**
- ✅ Should show student details
- ✅ Should show "Defense Schedule" section
- ✅ Should show defense information with:
  - Defense Date
  - Defense Type
  - OR Number
  - Payment breakdown by panelist:
    - asdasdasd (Panel Chair) - ₱12,313.00
    - Dr Mumbo Jumbo (Panel Member 1) - ₱12,313.00
    - John EStano (Panel Member 2) - ₱12,313.00

### 4. Test AA Workflow (New Trigger)

To test the new workflow where records are created when AA marks as "ready_for_finance":

1. Create a new defense request (or use existing)
2. Go to AA Payment Verification page
3. Change status to **"ready_for_finance"**
4. **Immediately** check:
   - `/honorarium` - new records should appear
   - `/student-records` - new student should appear

**Previous Behavior**: Records only created when workflow_state = "completed"
**New Behavior**: Records created when AA status = "ready_for_finance"

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "No panelists found" or empty records

**Solution**: Run the resync script
```bash
php resync_with_fixes.php
```

### Issue: Roles not showing in pivot table

**Check**: Run verification
```bash
php verify_synced_data.php
```

### Issue: Observer not triggering

**Check logs**:
```bash
tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log
```

Look for:
```
AaPaymentVerificationObserver: Status changed to ready_for_finance
StudentRecordSyncService: Starting sync
```
