## 🐛 DEBUGGING CHECKLIST

If confirmations don't show:
- [ ] Check browser console for errors
- [ ] Verify `confirm()` is not blocked by browser
- [ ] Check if clicking button triggers console log

If loading toasts don't show:
- [ ] Verify `sonner` is imported
- [ ] Check if `toast.loading()` is called
- [ ] Look for any toast library conflicts

If updates don't persist:
- [ ] Check Network tab for 200 response
- [ ] Verify `setDetails()` or `setDefenseRequests()` is called
- [ ] Check if backend returns `success: true`
