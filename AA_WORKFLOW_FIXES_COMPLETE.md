# AA Workflow Fixes - Complete Summary

## 🎯 Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ AA Details Page - Missing Coordinator Information
**Problem:** The coordinator name was not displayed in the AA details page.

**Solution:**
- Updated `DefenseRequestController::showAADetails()` to fetch and include coordinator information
- Added coordinator object with `id`, `name`, and `email` to the response
- Frontend now properly displays coordinator name in the details card

**Files Changed:**
- `app/Http/Controllers/DefenseRequestController.php` (lines 2103-2203)
- `resources/js/pages/assistant/all-defense-list/details.tsx` (type definitions)

---

### 2. ✅ AA Status Not Updating
**Problem:** AA verification status wasn't being properly tracked and updated.

**Solution:**
- Backend now properly loads `aaVerification` relationship using `->with('aaVerification')`
- Added `aa_verification_status` and `aa_verification_id` to the response
- Frontend correctly displays and updates AA status
- Status badges work properly: Pending → Ready for Finance → In Progress → Paid → Completed

**Files Changed:**
- `app/Http/Controllers/DefenseRequestController.php`
- `resources/js/pages/assistant/all-defense-list/details.tsx`

---

### 3. ✅ Receivables Not Calculated
**Problem:** The committee table wasn't showing receivable amounts for panel members.

**Solution:**
- Added `program_level` to the backend response
- Backend now calculates `expected_rate` as sum of all payment rates (not just School Share)
- Frontend `getMemberReceivable()` function now works correctly with proper program_level
- Receivables are displayed in the committee table for all roles

**Key Logic:**
- **Adviser:** Gets "Adviser" rate from PaymentRate table
- **All Panel Members (Chair + Members 1-4):** Get "Panel Chair" rate from PaymentRate table

**Files Changed:**
- `app/Http/Controllers/DefenseRequestController.php` (showAADetails method)
- `resources/js/pages/assistant/all-defense-list/details.tsx` (getMemberReceivable function)

---

### 4. ✅ Panel Member Count by Program Level
**Problem:** The committee table showed all 4 panelists regardless of program level.

**Solution:**
- **Masteral:** Shows Chair + 3 Panelists (total 4 panel members)
- **Doctorate:** Shows Chair + 4 Panelists (total 5 panel members)
- Committee table now conditionally renders based on `program_level`

**Files Changed:**
- `resources/js/pages/assistant/all-defense-list/details.tsx` (lines 645-680)

---

### 5. ✅ "Ready for Finance" Creates Records
**Problem:** Changing AA status to "ready_for_finance" didn't create HonorariumPayment, StudentRecord, and PanelistRecord entries.

**Solution:**
- Updated `PaymentVerificationController::updateStatusByDefenseRequest()` to detect status change
- When status changes to `ready_for_finance`:
  1. **Creates HonorariumPayment records** for:
     - Adviser (with Adviser rate)
     - Panel Chair (with Panel Chair rate)
     - Panel Members 1-4 (with Panel Chair rate)
  2. **Triggers StudentRecordSyncService** which:
     - Creates/updates ProgramRecord
     - Creates/updates StudentRecord with defense info
     - Creates/updates PanelistRecord for each panel member
     - Creates/updates PaymentRecord linking students and panelists
     - Links panelists to students with roles in pivot table

**Files Changed:**
- `app/Http/Controllers/AA/PaymentVerificationController.php` (lines 47-170)

## 📋 Data Flow

```
Coordinator Approves Defense
         ↓
AA Reviews in Details Page
         ↓
AA Sets Status → "Ready for Finance"
         ↓
Backend Creates Records:
  ├─ HonorariumPayment (Adviser + 4-5 Panel Members)
  ├─ StudentRecord (with defense info)
  ├─ PanelistRecord (for each panel member)
  ├─ PaymentRecord (links students & panelists)
  └─ Pivot table (student_panelist with roles)
         ↓
Records Appear in:
  ├─ Student Records Page (individual-records.tsx)
  ├─ Panelist Records Page (panelist-individual-record.tsx)
  └─ Honorarium Summary
```

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test script to verify all fixes:

```bash
php test_aa_workflow.php
```

### Manual Testing Checklist

1. **Coordinator Name Display**
   - [ ] Visit AA details page
   - [ ] Verify coordinator name shows in "Program Coordinator" field
   - [ ] Check coordinator email is available (in backend data)

2. **Receivables Calculation**
   - [ ] Check Committee table shows amounts
   - [ ] Verify Adviser has Adviser rate
   - [ ] Verify all panel members have Panel Chair rate
   - [ ] Confirm Masteral shows 4 rows, Doctorate shows 5 rows

3. **AA Status Updates**
   - [ ] Update status to "Ready for Finance"
   - [ ] Check status badge updates
   - [ ] Verify button states change correctly

4. **Record Creation**
   - [ ] Set status to "Ready for Finance"
   - [ ] Check HonorariumPayments table (should have 5-6 records)
   - [ ] Verify StudentRecord created with defense info
   - [ ] Confirm PanelistRecords created for all panel members
   - [ ] Check PaymentRecords link students and panelists

5. **Records Display**
   - [ ] Go to Student Records page
   - [ ] Find the student and view individual record
   - [ ] Verify defense appears with all panelists
   - [ ] Go to Honorarium → Panelist Records
   - [ ] View individual panelist record

## 🗄️ Database Tables Involved

1. **defense_requests** - Main defense request data
2. **aa_payment_verifications** - AA verification status tracking
3. **honorarium_payments** - Individual panel member payments
4. **student_records** - Student defense history
5. **panelist_records** - Panelist information

## 📊 Payment Rate Logic

### Rate Types
- **Adviser**: Rate for thesis adviser
- **Panel Chair**: Rate for all panel members (chair + members)
- **REC Fee**: Research Ethics Committee fee
- **School Share**: School's portion

### Calculation
```
For each defense request:
  Program Level = getMasteralOrDoctorate(program)
  Defense Type = "Proposal" | "Pre-Final" | "Final"
  
  Rates = PaymentRate::where([
    'program_level' => Program Level,
    'defense_type' => Defense Type
  ])
  
  Adviser Amount = Rates['Adviser']
  Panel Member Amount = Rates['Panel Chair'] (same for all)
```

   - Verify integrations

3. **Monitor in Production**
   - Watch for errors in logs

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Receivables show as "—"
**Solution:** Ensure payment_rates table has entries for the program_level and defense_type

### Issue: Honorarium payments not created
**Solution:** Check logs for errors, verify PaymentRate entries exist

### Issue: Coordinator name missing
**Solution:** Verify defense_request has coordinator_user_id set

### Issue: Wrong panel member count
**Solution:** Check program_level is correctly determined from program name
