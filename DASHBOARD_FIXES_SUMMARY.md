# Dashboard Fixes Summary

## Overview
Fixed all dashboard metric cards and weekly defense schedule widgets across all user roles (Coordinator, Administrative Assistant, Dean, Faculty, and Student).

## Changes Made

### 1. **API Routes Added** (`routes/web.php`)
Added comprehensive dashboard metrics APIs:

- **`/api/pending-honorariums`** - Returns count of AA payment verifications with status 'pending', 'ready_for_finance', or 'in_progress'
- **`/api/todays-defenses`** - Returns count of approved defenses scheduled for today
- **`/api/pending-applications`** - Placeholder for future application model (currently returns 0)
- **`/api/pending-payments`** - Returns count of defense requests with pending payment submissions
- **`/api/pending-defense-requests`** - Returns count of pending defense requests (filtered by coordinator programs for coordinators)
- **`/api/panelists/count`** - Returns total panelists count
- **`/api/assigned-panelists/count`** - Returns count of unique panelists assigned to defense requests
- **`/api/coordinator/advisers`** - Returns advisers linked to coordinator's programs
- **`/api/coordinator/programs`** - Returns programs assigned to coordinator
- **`/api/calendar/events`** - Returns events within a date range for weekly schedule widget

### 2. **Coordinator Dashboard** (`coordinator-dashboard.tsx`)

#### Metrics Fixed:
- ✅ **Pending Honorariums** - Now fetches actual count from `AaPaymentVerification` table where status is 'pending', 'ready_for_finance', or 'in_progress'
- ✅ **Today's Defense Schedules** - Fetches real count from API instead of using dummy data
- ✅ **Pending Defense Requests** - Already dynamic (uses filtered requests)
- ✅ **Assigned Programs** - Fetches from `/api/coordinator/programs`
- ✅ **Advisers** - Fetches from `/api/coordinator/advisers`
- ✅ **Panelists** - Uses real count from props or API

#### Widget Fixed:
- ✅ **Weekly Defense Schedules Widget** - Now receives `userRole` and `canManage` props
- ✅ Shows both defense schedules AND general events from the calendar
- ✅ Properly filters and displays events for the selected day

### 3. **Administrative Assistant Dashboard** (`assistant-dashboard.tsx`)

#### Metrics Fixed:
- ✅ **Pending Honorariums** - Fetches actual count from API (AA payment verifications with status 'pending', 'ready_for_finance', 'in_progress')
- ✅ **Today's Defense Schedules** - Fetches real count from API
- ✅ **Pending Applications** - Placeholder API (returns 0 for now)
- ✅ **Payment Confirmations** - Placeholder (kept as is per requirement)
- ✅ **Defense Requests** - Fetches real count from API

#### Widget Fixed:
- ✅ **Weekly Defense Schedules Widget** - Now receives `userRole` and `canManage` props
- ✅ Shows both defense schedules AND general events

### 4. **Dean Dashboard** (`dean-dashboard.tsx`)
- ✅ **Weekly Defense Schedules Widget** - Added `userRole` and `canManage` props
- ✅ Shows all defense schedules and events (can manage)

### 5. **Faculty Dashboard** (`faculty-dashboard.tsx`)
- ✅ **Weekly Defense Schedules Widget** - Added `userRole` and `canManage={false}` props
- ✅ Shows all defense schedules and events (view-only)

### 6. **Student Dashboard** (`student-dashboard.tsx`)
- ✅ **Weekly Defense Schedules Widget** - Added `userRole="Student"` and `canManage={false}` props
- ✅ **IMPORTANT**: Students only see THEIR OWN defenses (filtered by `studentId`)
- ✅ Students still see ALL general calendar events
- ✅ This ensures students don't see other students' defense schedules

### 7. **Weekly Defense Schedule Widget** (`weekly-defense-schedule-widget.tsx`)

#### Major Improvements:
- ✅ Now fetches general calendar events from `/api/calendar/events`
- ✅ Combines defense schedules and general events in one view
- ✅ Properly filters defenses for students (only shows their own)
- ✅ Displays both "Defense" and "Event" badges with different colors
- ✅ Shows event times or "All Day" for all-day events
- ✅ Sorts events by time (all-day first, then by start time)
- ✅ Fixed dependency array to include `userRole` in useMemo

## How Pending Honorariums Work

The **Pending Honorariums** metric now correctly reflects the actual status of AA payment verifications:

1. When a defense is completed, an `AaPaymentVerification` record is created with status `'pending'`
2. AA can update the status through the workflow:
   - `pending` → `ready_for_finance` → `in_progress` → `paid` → `completed`
3. The metric counts all verifications with status:
   - `'pending'`
   - `'ready_for_finance'`
   - `'in_progress'`
4. Once marked as `'paid'` or `'completed'`, it no longer appears in the pending count

## Weekly Schedule Widget Behavior

### For All Roles (Except Students):
- Shows ALL defense schedules with status "Approved"
- Shows ALL general calendar events
- Can see other users' defense schedules

### For Students:
- Shows ONLY THEIR OWN defense schedules (filtered by `submitted_by === studentId`)
- Shows ALL general calendar events
- Cannot see other students' defense schedules

### Events Display:
- **Defense**: Green badge with graduation cap icon
- **Event**: Gray/Blue badge with calendar icon
- Shows time range (e.g., "9:00 AM – 11:00 AM")
- Shows "All Day" for all-day events
- Empty state: "No schedules." when no items for selected day

## Files Modified

1. `routes/web.php` - Added all dashboard metric APIs
2. `app/Http/Controllers/DashboardController.php` - Already had panelists data
3. `resources/js/pages/dashboard/dashboard-layouts/coordinator-dashboard.tsx` - Fixed metrics and widget
4. `resources/js/pages/dashboard/dashboard-layouts/assistant-dashboard.tsx` - Fixed metrics and widget
5. `resources/js/pages/dashboard/dashboard-layouts/dean-dashboard.tsx` - Fixed widget props
6. `resources/js/pages/dashboard/dashboard-layouts/faculty-dashboard.tsx` - Fixed widget props

## Database Tables Used

- `aa_payment_verifications` - For pending honorariums count
- `defense_requests` - For defense schedules and counts
- `events` - For general calendar events
- `panelists` - For panelist counts
- `defense_request_panelist` - For assigned panelists count
- `users` - For adviser counts

## Notes

- Payment confirmations and pending applications remain as placeholders since the models aren't fully implemented yet
- The `AaPaymentVerification` model uses the correct table name and relationships
- All APIs use session-based authentication (middleware: 'auth')
- Calendar events use the `Event` model with `between` scope for efficient date filtering
- Student privacy is maintained - they only see their own defense schedules
