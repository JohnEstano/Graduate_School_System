## üß™ POST-DEPLOYMENT TESTING

### Test 1: Coordinator Dialog Opens
- [ ] Login as coordinator
- [ ] Navigate to defense requests
- [ ] Find an endorsed request (adviser_status = "Approved")
- [ ] Click "Approve & Sign" or "Review" button
- [ ] **Expected**: Dialog opens without errors
- [ ] **Expected**: Existing endorsement form loads in iframe

### Test 2: PDF Display
- [ ] In coordinator dialog, stay on "Preview" tab
- [ ] **Expected**: PDF displays in iframe
- [ ] **Expected**: Adviser signature is visible
- [ ] **Expected**: No console errors
- [ ] **Expected**: PDF is scrollable/zoomable

### Test 3: Signature Management
- [ ] Click "Signature" tab
- [ ] **Expected**: Active signature displays (if any)
- [ ] Click "Draw Signature" button
- [ ] Draw a signature and click "Save"
- [ ] **Expected**: Signature saves successfully
- [ ] **Expected**: New signature appears in grid
- [ ] Click "Set Active" on a signature
- [ ] **Expected**: Signature becomes active

### Test 4: Approval Process
- [ ] Ensure active signature is set
- [ ] Go back to "Preview" tab
- [ ] Click "Approve & Sign" button
- [ ] **Expected**: Loading spinner appears
- [ ] **Expected**: No console errors
- [ ] **Expected**: Success toast message
- [ ] **Expected**: Dialog closes
- [ ] **Expected**: Status updates to "Approved"

### Test 5: PDF Integrity
- [ ] Download the final endorsement form
- [ ] Open in PDF viewer
- [ ] **Expected**: Adviser signature is present
- [ ] **Expected**: Coordinator signature is present
- [ ] **Expected**: Both signatures are clearly visible
- [ ] **Expected**: All other content is intact
- [ ] **Expected**: No visual artifacts or corruption

### Test 6: Database Verification
```sql
-- Check endorsement_form path updated
SELECT id, endorsement_form, coordinator_status 
FROM defense_requests 
WHERE id = [test_request_id];

-- Expected: 
-- endorsement_form = /storage/generated/defense/coordinator_signed_[timestamp]_[filename].pdf
-- coordinator_status = 'Approved'
```

### Test 7: File System Verification
```bash
# Check new PDF exists
ls -lh storage/app/public/generated/defense/coordinator_signed_*

# Check old PDF deleted
# (Should not find the original endorsement file)

# Check signature image exists
ls -lh storage/app/public/signatures/[coordinator_user_id]/*
```

## üêõ TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: Dialog doesn't open
**Check**:
- Browser console for JavaScript errors
- Network tab for failed API calls
- Laravel logs: `tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log`

**Fix**:
- Clear browser cache
- Rebuild frontend: `npm run dev`
- Check route is registered: `php artisan route:list | grep coordinator`

### Issue: PDF doesn't load
**Check**:
- endorsement_form path in database
- File exists in storage
- File permissions (should be 644)
- Storage symlink: `ls -la public/storage`

**Fix**:
```bash
# Re-create storage symlink
php artisan storage:link

# Fix permissions
chmod 644 storage/app/public/endorsements/*
```

### Issue: Signature doesn't appear on PDF
**Check**:
- Coordinator has active signature
- Signature image file exists
- FPDI is installed
- GD extension is enabled

**Fix**:
```bash
# Install FPDI if missing
composer require setasign/fpdi

# Enable GD extension (in php.ini)
extension=gd

# Restart PHP-FPM/Apache
sudo service php8.1-fpm restart
```

### Issue: "Unauthorized" error
**Check**:
- User role is Coordinator, Administrative Assistant, or Dean
- User is logged in
- CSRF token is valid

**Fix**:
- Clear browser cookies
- Re-login
- Check middleware in route definition

### Issue: Performance problems
**Check**:
- PDF file size (should be <10MB)
- Server memory limit
- PHP execution time limit

**Fix**:
```bash
# Increase PHP limits (in php.ini)
memory_limit = 256M
max_execution_time = 120
```

## üìä MONITORING

### Logs to Watch
```bash
# Laravel application logs
tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log | grep -i "coordinator\|signature\|overlay"

# Web server logs
tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log
# or
tail -f /var/log/apache2/error.log

# PHP-FPM logs
tail -f /var/log/php8.1-fpm.log
```

### Key Log Messages (Success)
```
PdfSignatureOverlay: Adding coordinator signature
PdfSignatureOverlay: Using signature position
PdfSignatureOverlay: Signature added to page 1
PdfSignatureOverlay: Signed PDF created
Coordinator signature added successfully
```

### Key Log Messages (Errors to Watch For)
```
No active signature found for coordinator
Source PDF not found
Signature image not found
Failed to add coordinator signature
```

## üîÑ ROLLBACK PLAN

If critical issues occur:

### Quick Rollback
```bash
# Restore backups
cp resources/js/pages/coordinator/submissions/defense-request/coordinator-approve-dialog.tsx.backup \
   resources/js/pages/coordinator/submissions/defense-request/coordinator-approve-dialog.tsx

cp app/Http/Controllers/DefenseRequestController.php.backup \
   app/Http/Controllers/DefenseRequestController.php

cp routes/web.php.backup routes/web.php

# Rebuild frontend
npm run build

# Clear caches
php artisan route:clear
php artisan config:clear
```

### Database Rollback (if needed)
```sql
-- If any records were corrupted, restore from backup
-- OR manually fix paths:
UPDATE defense_requests 
SET endorsement_form = '[original_path]'
WHERE id = [affected_id];
```
