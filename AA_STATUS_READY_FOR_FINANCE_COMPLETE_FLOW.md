# AA Status "Ready for Finance" - Complete Data Flow

## Overview
When an Administrative Assistant changes the AA verification status to **"ready_for_finance"**, the system automatically creates all necessary records for both the Honorarium and Student Records pages.

---

## üîÑ Complete Flow

### 1. **PaymentVerificationController::updateStatusByDefenseRequest()**
**File**: `app/Http/Controllers/AA/PaymentVerificationController.php`

When status becomes `ready_for_finance`:
```php
// ‚úÖ Creates Honorarium Payment Records
createHonorariumRecords($defenseRequest);

// ‚úÖ Triggers Student Record Sync
$syncService->syncDefenseToStudentRecord($defenseRequest);
```

---

## üìä Records Created

### 2. **Honorarium Payment Records** (`honorarium_payments` table)
**Created by**: `PaymentVerificationController::createHonorariumRecords()`

Creates **separate records** for each panelist:

| Role | Rate Used | Included in Honorarium Page |
|------|-----------|----------------------------|
| Adviser | Adviser rate | ‚ùå No (excluded) |
| Panel Chair | Panel Chair rate | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Panel Member 1 | Panel Member 1 rate | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Panel Member 2 | Panel Member 2 rate | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Panel Member 3 | Panel Member 3 rate | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Panel Member 4 | Panel Member 4 rate | ‚úÖ Yes |

**Fields Created**:
```php
[
    'defense_request_id' => $defenseRequest->id,
    'panelist_name' => 'Full Name',
    'role' => 'Panel Chair' | 'Panel Member 1-4' | 'Adviser',
    'panelist_type' => 'faculty',
    'amount' => $rate->amount, // Role-specific amount
    'payment_status' => 'pending',
    'defense_date' => $defenseRequest->scheduled_date,
    'student_name' => 'Student Full Name',
    'program' => $defenseRequest->program,
    'defense_type' => $defenseRequest->defense_type,
]
```

---

### 3. **Program Record** (`program_records` table)
**Created by**: `StudentRecordSyncService::syncDefenseToStudentRecord()`

```php
[
    'name' => $defenseRequest->program,
    'program' => $defenseRequest->program,
    'category' => 'Masteral' | 'Doctorate', // Auto-detected
    'recently_updated' => 0,
    'time_last_opened' => now(),
    'date_edited' => now(),
]
```

**Used for**: Grouping students and panelists by program in `/honorarium` and `/student-records`.

---

### 4. **Student Record** (`student_records` table)
**Created by**: `StudentRecordSyncService::syncDefenseToStudentRecord()`

**One record per defense** (not updated if student has multiple defenses):

```php
[
    'student_id' => $defenseRequest->school_id,
    'first_name' => $defenseRequest->first_name,
    'middle_name' => $defenseRequest->middle_name,
    'last_name' => $defenseRequest->last_name,
    'program' => $defenseRequest->program,
    'program_record_id' => $programRecord->id,
    'school_year' => '2025-2026', // Auto-calculated
    'defense_date' => $defenseRequest->scheduled_date,
    'defense_type' => $defenseRequest->defense_type,
    'defense_request_id' => $defenseRequest->id,
    'or_number' => $defenseRequest->reference_no,
    'payment_date' => $defenseRequest->payment_date,
]
```

---

### 5. **Panelist Records** (`panelist_records` table)
**Created by**: `StudentRecordSyncService::syncDefenseToStudentRecord()`

**Important**: Only creates records for **Panel Chair** and **Panel Members** (Advisers excluded).

**One record per panelist per defense**:

```php
[
    'pfirst_name' => 'First',
    'pmiddle_name' => 'Middle',
    'plast_name' => 'Last',
    'program_record_id' => $programRecord->id,
    'defense_type' => $defenseRequest->defense_type,
    'received_date' => $paymentDate,
    'role' => 'Panel Chair' | 'Panel Member 1-4',
]
```

**Unique Constraint**: Combination of `pfirst_name`, `plast_name`, `program_record_id`, `defense_type`, and `received_date`.

---

### 6. **Payment Records** (`payment_records` table)
**Created by**: `StudentRecordSyncService::syncDefenseToStudentRecord()`

**One record per panelist** (excluding Advisers):

```php
[
    'student_record_id' => $studentRecord->id,
    'panelist_record_id' => $panelistRecord->id,
    'defense_request_id' => $defenseRequest->id,
    'school_year' => '2025-2026',
    'payment_date' => $paymentDate,
    'defense_status' => 'completed',
    'amount' => $honorariumPayment->amount, // Role-specific
    'role' => 'Panel Chair' | 'Panel Member 1-4', // ‚úÖ Stored for accuracy
]
```

**This links students to panelists with payment amounts.**

---

### 7. **Pivot Table** (`panelist_student_records`)
**Created by**: `StudentRecordSyncService::syncDefenseToStudentRecord()`

**Links students to panelists** with their roles:

```php
[
    'student_id' => $studentRecord->id,
    'panelist_id' => $panelistRecord->id,
    'role' => 'Panel Chair' | 'Panel Member 1-4',
]
```

## üö® Common Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: All panel members getting same rate
**Fixed**: Each panel member now gets their numbered rate (Panel Member 1, 2, 3, 4)

### Issue 2: Advisers showing on honorarium page
**Fixed**: Advisers are now excluded from panelist_records and filtered out in HonorariumSummaryController

### Issue 3: Wrong receivables displayed
**Fixed**: Now uses role-specific payment amounts from payment_records

### Issue 4: Missing program_level error
**Fixed**: PaymentVerificationController now calculates program_level from program name using ProgramLevel::getLevel()
