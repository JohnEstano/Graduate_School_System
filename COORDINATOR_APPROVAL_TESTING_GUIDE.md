#### Step 5: Verify Everything Was Saved
Open your browser console (F12) and check the logs:
```
âœ… Document saved successfully, updating coordinator status...
ðŸ“‹ Including panel assignments: {...}
ðŸ“… Including schedule data: {...}
ðŸ“¤ Updating coordinator status with payload: {...}
âœ… Approval successful
```

### 3. Database Verification

Run this query to verify all data was saved:

```sql
SELECT 
  id,
  thesis_title,
  coordinator_status,
  workflow_state,
  -- Panel assignments
  defense_chairperson,
  defense_panelist1,
  defense_panelist2,
  defense_panelist3,
  defense_panelist4,
  panels_assigned_at,
  -- Schedule
  scheduled_date,
  scheduled_time,
  scheduled_end_time,
  defense_mode,
  defense_venue,
  scheduling_notes,
  -- Document
  endorsement_form,
  -- Metadata
  last_status_updated_at,
  last_status_updated_by
FROM defense_requests 
WHERE id = <YOUR_TEST_REQUEST_ID>;
```

### Expected Results:
âœ… `coordinator_status` = 'Approved'
âœ… `workflow_state` = 'scheduled' (if both panels and schedule provided)
âœ… `defense_chairperson` = (the name you entered)
âœ… `defense_panelist1` = (the name you entered)
âœ… `scheduled_date` = (the date you entered)
âœ… `scheduled_time` = (the time you entered)
âœ… `defense_mode` = (Online/Face-to-Face/Hybrid)
âœ… `defense_venue` = (the venue you entered)
âœ… `endorsement_form` = (file path, e.g., 'defense_documents/xyz.pdf')
âœ… `panels_assigned_at` = (recent timestamp)
âœ… `last_status_updated_at` = (recent timestamp)

### 4. Check Workflow History

```sql
SELECT JSON_PRETTY(workflow_history) 
FROM defense_requests 
WHERE id = <YOUR_TEST_REQUEST_ID>;
```

You should see an entry like:
```json
{
  "event_type": "coordinator-status-update",
  "from_state": "adviser-approved",
  "to_state": "scheduled",
  "description": "Coordinator updated status to Approved and assigned panels and set schedule",
  "user_name": "Your Name",
  "created_at": "2025-10-27 ..."
}
```

### 5. Check File Upload

```bash
# Navigate to storage
cd storage/app/public/defense_documents

# List recent files
ls -lt | head -5
```

You should see the endorsement form PDF file.

### 6. Check Logs

```bash
# View the Laravel log
tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log
```

Look for entries like:
```
[2025-10-27 ...] local.INFO: uploadDocuments called {"defense_request_id":123,...}
[2025-10-27 ...] local.INFO: Endorsement form uploaded {"path":"defense_documents/xyz.pdf",...}
[2025-10-27 ...] local.INFO: Panels saved during coordinator approval {...}
[2025-10-27 ...] local.INFO: Schedule saved during coordinator approval {...}
[2025-10-27 ...] local.INFO: Coordinator status updated successfully {...}
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Failed to save document"
**Solution:** Check file upload permissions
```bash
chmod -R 775 storage/app/public/defense_documents
```

### Issue 2: Panels not saving
**Problem:** Panel data not being passed from details page
**Solution:** Make sure you filled the panel fields before clicking Approve

### Issue 3: Schedule not saving  
**Problem:** Schedule data not being passed from details page
**Solution:** Make sure you filled the schedule fields before clicking Approve

### Issue 4: Email not sent
**Check:** Mailpit is running
```bash
# Check if Mailpit is accessible
curl http://localhost:8025
```

### Issue 5: Database shows NULL for panels
**Debug:** Check browser console for the payload being sent
```javascript
// You should see in console:
{
  coordinator_status: "Approved",
  send_email: true,
  defense_chairperson: "Dr. Smith",
  defense_panelist1: "Dr. Jones",
  scheduled_date: "2025-11-15",
  // ... etc
}
```

## Advanced Testing

### Test Different Scenarios:

#### Scenario A: Panels Only
1. Fill panels
2. Leave schedule empty
3. Approve
4. **Expected:** `workflow_state` = 'panels-assigned'

#### Scenario B: Schedule Only
1. Leave panels empty
2. Fill schedule
3. Approve
4. **Expected:** `workflow_state` = 'coordinator-approved'

#### Scenario C: Full Data
1. Fill both panels and schedule
2. Approve
3. **Expected:** `workflow_state` = 'scheduled'

#### Scenario D: No Data (Just Endorsement Form)
1. Leave panels and schedule empty
2. Approve
3. **Expected:** `workflow_state` = 'coordinator-approved', panels and schedule remain NULL

## Success Criteria

âœ… All panel members saved to database
âœ… All schedule fields saved to database
âœ… Endorsement form file saved to storage
âœ… Workflow state updated correctly
âœ… Workflow history logged
âœ… Email sent (if selected)
âœ… No errors in browser console
âœ… No errors in Laravel logs
âœ… Page refreshes and shows "Approved" status
