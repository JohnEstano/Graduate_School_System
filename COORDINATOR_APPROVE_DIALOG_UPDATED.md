---

## üîÑ New Workflow

### **Step 1: Open Dialog**
- Loads existing endorsement form from adviser (from storage)
- Loads user's signature library
- Shows coordinator info input fields (full name, title)

### **Step 2: Enter Information**
- Coordinator enters their full name (required)
- Optionally updates their title (defaults to "Program Coordinator")
- Selects or creates their signature

### **Step 3: Review & Approve**
- Preview the endorsement form in an iframe
- Click "Approve Request" button
- Email confirmation dialog appears

### **Step 4: Email Confirmation**
- Dialog asks: "Send email notification to student?"
- Options:
  - **Cancel**: Goes back to review
  - **Confirm Approval**: Proceeds with approval and sends notification to student if checked

### **Step 5: Submit**
- PATCH request to `/coordinator/defense-requirements/{id}/coordinator-status`
- Payload includes:
  ```json
  {
    "coordinator_status": "Approved",
    "coordinator_full_name": "...",
    "coordinator_title": "...",
    "coordinator_user_id": ...,
    "send_email": true/false
  }
  ```
- Callback `onApproveComplete()` executes (refreshes page)
- Dialog closes
- Success toast shown

## üìã Key Features

### **Coordinator Information Section**
```tsx
<div className="space-y-3">
  <Label>Your Information</Label>
  <Input
    placeholder="Enter your full name"
    value={coordinatorFullName}
    onChange={(e) => setCoordinatorFullName(e.target.value)}
  />
  <Input
    placeholder="e.g., Program Coordinator"
    value={coordinatorTitle}
    onChange={(e) => setCoordinatorTitle(e.target.value)}
  />
</div>
```

### **Email Confirmation Dialog**
```tsx
<Dialog open={showEmailDialog}>
  <DialogContent>
    <DialogTitle>Send Email Notification?</DialogTitle>
    <Checkbox
      checked={sendEmail}
      onCheckedChange={(checked) => setSendEmail(checked === true)}
    />
    <Label>Send email notification to student</Label>
    <Button onClick={handleFinalApprove}>Confirm Approval</Button>
  </DialogContent>
</Dialog>
```

### **Signature Management**
- Same system as adviser's endorsement dialog
- Load existing signatures from `/api/signatures`
- Draw new signature with `SignatureCanvas`
- Activate signature with PATCH `/api/signatures/{id}/activate`
- Active signature shown with preview

---

## üîß Backend Integration

### **Endpoint: PATCH `/coordinator/defense-requirements/{id}/coordinator-status`**

**Expected Payload:**
```json
{
  "coordinator_status": "Approved",
  "coordinator_full_name": "Dr. John Smith",
  "coordinator_title": "Program Coordinator",
  "coordinator_user_id": 123,
  "send_email": true
}
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "message": "Coordinator status updated successfully",
  "request": { /* updated defense request object */ }
}
```

### **Email Functionality**
- When `send_email: true`, backend should send notification email to:
  - **Student** (defense request submitter)
  - Optionally: Adviser, panel members
- Email should indicate that coordinator has approved the request
- Include defense details (date, time, venue, panels)

## üîç Comparison: Old vs New

| Feature | Old Workflow | New Workflow |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| **Document Generation** | Regenerated entire PDF | Uses existing PDF from adviser |
| **Signature Placement** | Drag-and-drop positioning | No positioning needed |
| **Coordinator Info** | Not captured | Full name + title required |
| **Email Notification** | Not asked | Confirmation dialog with checkbox |
| **Complexity** | ~700 lines, 3 tabs | ~550 lines, single view |
| **User Steps** | 5-7 clicks | 3-4 clicks |
| **Template System** | Required template selection | Not needed |
| **Upload Option** | Could upload custom PDF | Not needed |

## üöÄ Benefits

1. **Simpler Workflow**: Coordinators don't regenerate documents
2. **Faster Approval**: Fewer steps, less confusion
3. **Better UX**: Clear, focused interface
4. **Data Capture**: Records coordinator name and title
5. **Email Control**: User decides if notification sent
6. **Consistency**: Matches adviser's endorsement dialog
7. **Maintainability**: Less complex code, easier to debug
8. **No Signature Errors**: No coordinate calculations needed

---

## üìù Notes

- The coordinator's signature is **not overlaid** on the PDF in this version
- The approval is **recorded in the database** with coordinator info
- If signature overlay is needed in the future, it should be done server-side after approval
- The endorsement form remains **unchanged** - it already has the adviser's signature
- Coordinator approval is a **status change** with metadata (name, title, signature reference)

## üîó Related Files

- `endorsement-dialog.tsx` - Adviser's endorsement dialog (reference implementation)
- `details.tsx` - Main coordinator details page
- Backend routes:
  - `PATCH /coordinator/defense-requirements/{id}/coordinator-status`
  - `GET /api/signatures`
  - `POST /api/signatures`
  - `PATCH /api/signatures/{id}/activate`

## üéâ Summary

The coordinator approve dialog now follows the **same pattern** as the adviser's endorsement dialog:
1. Load existing document
2. Capture user information
3. Select signature
4. Confirm with email option
5. Submit approval

This provides a **consistent, intuitive experience** across both roles while significantly reducing complexity and potential errors.
